 * This program is a tool for fantasy basketball players to use. When you play fantasy basketball, you have to set
 * your roster to put out at the beginning of each week. The process of comparing every single player on your roster
 * to other players and determining which ones you should put out is a very time-consuming process that sometimes
 * ruins the experience of fantasy basketball. People become too lazy to update their roster and end up not putting
 * out their best lineup which means they end up losing every week. My program is a tool that can be used by fantasy
 * players to see what the most ideal roster they can put out is and see suggestions for their roster. There are also
 * additional features such as viewing the scores of yesterdayâ€™s games. You can also view more information of each
 * game such as the box score stats (points, rebounds, and assists of each player in the game).
